# Stop Watch

Clear a simple coded stop watch using vanilla javascript; it is used for those who are related noobs in coding, including me.


## Functionalities 

1) Start timer
On click of start button, start the timer
If timer is 0 start from beginning else start from wherever last stopped

2) Stop timer
Stop timer once clicked on the stop button

3) Reset button
On click of reset stop the watch (if already started) and set timer as 0
